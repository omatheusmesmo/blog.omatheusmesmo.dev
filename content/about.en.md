Hello! I'm glad you're here. ☕

I'm **Matheus Oliveira**, known online as **@omatheusmesmo**. I am a software developer who believes that **no code makes sense without the people behind it.**

### 🛠️ What I Work On
My expertise lies in the **Java** ecosystem and building scalable architectures. For me, software development is more than just writing code; it's about solving real problems and creating a positive impact for those who use the software.

### 🌍 Open Source Contributions
I'm a firm believer in the Open Source philosophy and the power of shared knowledge. My journey has allowed me to contribute to some of the industry's most significant projects:

* **Jakarta EE & Quarkus**: I actively contribute to these global standards and frameworks, helping shape the future of enterprise and Kubernetes-native Java.
* **BuildCLI**: I served as one of the lead maintainers of this automation tool, a project that granted me valuable visibility and experience within the community.

### ✍️ Why This Blog?
This blog is where I document my journey, sharing both my insights and the lessons learned from the things I've broken along the way. I write about Java, Cloud, architecture, and the human side of being a developer.

I hope you find something here that helps you on your own journey as much as sharing it helps me on mine.
